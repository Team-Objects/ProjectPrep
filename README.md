Set time, breakdown, sticking to a pre-planned schedule

30 minute check in - before or after lunch follow up. Working at the same table in Remo.Utilizing a group slack message.

Knowing what needs to be done and when. Use the GitHub projects.

### Conflict

make time to explain the code you've written. Have regular code reviews so everyone can understand the whole project.

Monday morning - group coding session to establish naming conventions.

Call in Audrey when needed for any major conflict or someone is refusing help.

Have open conversation where each side is heard.

Develop "mission statement" for project to establish common goal/ground.

For raising concerns - offer help, be upfront when an issue arises.

### Communication

Structure around check in times:

- what did you have problems with?
- what do you need help with?
- what went well?

Use slack to communicate. Work primarily during class hours. Open to extending hours if needed. Want to maintain boundaries between work/code time and home time.

9am check ins time. everyone will speak during check in times. Will ask clarifying questions and briefback.

Ensuring a safe environment through open communication.

### Workplan

Will use GitHub project to manage work. Assign names to tasks and keep up on "to do," "in progress," and "to TEST"

### Git Process

All components will be on GitHub, including our project planning. We will share the repo as instructed in lecture. We will only merge doing group meetings and will try to merge twice a day to capture the morning's work and the afternoon's work. We will be using a PR review with two approvals requird to merge.
